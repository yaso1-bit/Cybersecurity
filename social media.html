    <h1>Social Media Security</h1>

    <ul>
        <li>Social media is a collective term for websites and applications that focus on communication, community-based input, interaction, content-sharing and collaboration.</li> 
    <br>
        <li>As organizations increasingly rely on social media to grow their brands, attackers leverage the inherent trust and public nature of these platforms to conduct attacks. Protecting brands, executives, employees and consumers on social media is critical for modern business success.</li>
    <br>
        <li>So, to control this social media and ensure our safety from hackers and bullies, Social Media Security has been introduced.</li>
    </ul>
